# Jupiter Exchange Python API Code Examples

This repo contains practical code examples and implementations designed to help developers work with the [Jupiter Exchange APIs](https://station.jup.ag/docs/). Our goal is to empower developers with the knowledge and inspiration to build innovative applications leveraging Jupiter's ecosystem.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/jupiter-api-examples.git
cd jupiter-api-examples
```

2. Set up the required environment variables:

   - Scripts in this repository rely on environment variables to securely store sensitive information such as private keys and RPC URLs.

   - Copy the file `.env-example` to `.env`:

     ```bash
     cp .env-example .env
     ```

   - Open the `.env` file and fill in the required values:

     ```bash
     PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
     RPC_URL=https://your_rpc_url_here
     ```

      - `PRIVATE_KEY`: This is your Base58-encoded private key used to sign transactions.
      - `RPC_URL`: This is the URL for your Solana RPC provider.

     **Note:**
      - Using a Solana native RPC provider with **staked connections** is highly recommended to ensure your transactions will be landing. If you're unsure what this is, read more here: [stake-weighted QoS (Quality of Service)](https://solana.com/developers/guides/advanced/stake-weighted-qos).
      - If you do not have access to a staked RPC provider, you can use Solana's default mainnet endpoint:  
        `https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com`.

3. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run any example script in the repository:
```bash
python script.py
```

Each example in this repository has its own `requirements.txt` file to list the specific dependencies needed to run that script.

5. Review the documentation to explore the full potential of the Jupiter Exchange APIs and learn how to integrate them into your projects:
   - [Jupiter API Docs](https://station.jup.ag/docs/)
   - [API Guides](https://station.jup.ag/guides/)
